# Welcome to RecsCreational!
#### This is a React web app I built as my semester-long project for my Intro to Web Development class during the spring of 2021.

Technologies and frameworks I used to build this app include: **JavaScript**, **HTML/CSS** and **React** for the frontend and **Node.js**, **Express**, **MongoDB** and **Postman** for the backend, and the app isdeployed using Heroku. You can view it live here: https://recscreational-react-app.herokuapp.com/ !

#### To use the app:
- Click on the "TV Shows" 📺, "Books" 📗 and "Music" 🎵 links in the navigation bar at the top to navigate to those sections on the webpage.
- Make selections in each category to view items.
- Click "Add to Checkout" 🛒 under any item to add items to checkout bin.
- Use buttons at the top of page: "Checkout" 🛍️ to view items placed in checkout bin, "Clear bin" 🗑️ to clear all items from bin, "Reset preferences" 🛎️ to reset all
selections, and "Share" 🌎 to share items in Checkout with friends.
- Once in checkout bin, click on item buttons in to remove items from checkout. ❌
